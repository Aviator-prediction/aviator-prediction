## ‚ùì What Is Aviator Predictor ‚ùì

Since Aviator has become widely popular from the moment of its release, a community of gambling enthusiasts decided to develop a special app for everyone who likes to bet smartly. It got the name ‚ÄúAviator Predictor,‚Äù and you can find it at **[https://aviator-predictor.ke](https://aviator-predictor.ke)**.

Some people think it‚Äôs an entirely useless tool that cannot predict anything. Others swear that it works and that they have already won a small fortune with its help. 

This is what the Aviator Predictor is supposed to do:

<ul>
<li>Analyze all previous rounds of Aviator and remember the patterns it sees, no matter how rarely they are encountered.</li>
<li>‚ÄòRead‚Äô the specifics of the rounds you‚Äôre playing right now.</li>
<li>Use the previous analysis and the present situation to predict the outcome of your next game.</li>
</ul>

There are other developers who claim that their predictor can foresee the Aviator outcomes in 99% of cases. Are they telling the truth? Not quite.

## ‚öñÔ∏è How to Use Aviator Predictor

The key to benefiting from Aviator Predictor is understanding what it can and can‚Äôt do. It‚Äôs not some magic invention that sees the future and reveals the results to you in advance. It‚Äôs an AI-powered machine that works with patterns.

Aviator is based on random number generation. Ask yourself, do you believe that random combinations can still have patterns? If you do, you‚Äôll like using the predictor because that‚Äôs exactly how it works. It catches on to similar situations and makes conclusions accordingly. 

For example, if the plane crashed at 2.3x multiplier just now, at 2.1x in the last round, and at 2x the round prior to that, the predictor might spot a pattern. It will suggest cashing out at 2.3x when you play Aviator next. 

Its accuracy rate cannot be established as it is as precise as the frequency of patterns. Either way, you can try the APP - just **[follow the link](https://aviator-predictor.ke)** on the site.
